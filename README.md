# PCNN Codebook 

This repository contains the harmonized codebook developed for the Post-COVID Netwerk Nederland (PCNN) research consortium. It supports researchers in understanding the structure, origin, and meaning of the variables used in Post-COVID and ME/CFS studies across different cohorts.

---

## Repository Structure
- `Codebook.xlsx` a simplified and structured version of the codebook, containing all variables, themes, labels, ontology mappings, and value codings (not Updated)
- `themes_and_subdomains.md` – A categorized list of all Themes and Subdomains used in the codebook.
- `instruments_overview.md` – Summary of all validated instruments and questionnaires represented in the codebook. ( will be updated)
---

## Purpose

This repository contains two main versions of the Post-COVID Network Netherlands (PCNN) harmonized codebook.
The codebooks aim to support data harmonization, FAIRification, and ontology alignment across different data sources and studies within the PCNN initiative.

---

##  1. codebook.xlsx — Researcher-Friendly Version (⚠️not updated)
This is a simplified and structured version of the codebook, designed for researchers who want to understand the available variables and metadata.
It includes key descriptive and FAIR-relevant columns needed for data interpretation and integration.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Theme | High-level domain (e.g., General Health, Symptoms) |
| Subdomain | Specific topic within the theme |
| Instrument | Questionnaire/tool used to collect the variable |
| Instrument version | Version info where applicable |
| Variable name DRE | Standardized internal name |
| Variable name - FAIR | Ontology-aligned term |
| Variable coding label | Suggested short label |
| Variable label - NL | Dutch label/question |
| Variable label - EN | English label/question |
| Value labels - NL | Dutch answer options |
| Value labels - EN | English answer options |
| Value coding | Numeric or categorical codes |
| Value label - FAIR | FAIR-aligned answer option |
| Source | Data origin (e.g., Portal, Biobank, Trials, Clinics) |

Note: This version will be updated periodically as ontology mappings and metadata validation progress.

## 2. Network_codebook-completeversion (.xlsx & .json)

This is the comprehensive internal version of the PCNN codebook.
It contains all metadata fields used for FAIRification, ontology mapping, provenance tracking, and review documentation.
It merges multiple source-specific codebooks (Portal, Biobank, Platform Trials, Expertise Clinics) and records reviewer input and proposed FAIR terms.


**َAim:
To serve as the main working document for the FAIRification process, including:
- variable-level ontology mapping
- review tracking (checked_by, FAIR_code_reviewed_by)
- harmonization across multiple data sources
- version management and provenance documentation

 File formats:
Both .xlsx (for human readability) and .json (for machine-readability, integration and maintenance).

##  Notes

- A number of variables and FAIR ontology mappings are currently under internal and external review. These elements will be gradually refined and expanded in subsequent releases, based on expert input and consortium-wide feedback.
- Future updates will include the addition of new instruments such as **Beighton Score** and **FUNCAP-27**, as well as expanded support for structured metadata.
